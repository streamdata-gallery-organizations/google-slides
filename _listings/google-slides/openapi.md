  /v1/presentations/{presentationId}:batchUpdate:
    post:
      summary: Update Presentation
      description: |-
        Applies one or more updates to the presentation.

        Each request is validated before
        being applied. If any request is not valid, then the entire request will
        fail and nothing will be applied.

        Some requests have replies to
        give you some information about how they are applied. Other requests do
        not need to return information; these each return an empty reply.
        The order of replies matches that of the requests.

        For example, suppose you call batchUpdate with four updates, and only the
        third one returns information. The response would have two empty replies:
        the reply to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order.

        Because other users may be editing the presentation, the presentation
        might not exactly reflect your changes: your changes may
        be altered with respect to collaborator changes. If there are no
        collaborators, the presentation should reflect your changes. In any case,
        the updates in your request are guaranteed to be applied together
        atomically.
